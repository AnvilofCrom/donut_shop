This is a model that simulates the hourly demand of donuts per Top Pot location during the daily opening hours from 7am - 6pm (11hrs).
It uses a random number generator to simulate demand together with information provided such as high/low customer count per hour, and average number of donuts purchased per customer.

hmmmmm....donuts...
